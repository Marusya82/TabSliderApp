# TabSliderApp
An Android app that shows different places nearby and lets the user select which type of place they want to see.

Features: Uses the current location to get a list of nearby places from the Google Places API (place types are caf√©s, bars and bistros/restaurants). Implements custom slider UI control that sets the type of place:
the slider can be dragged and always shows the place type it sits above;
on touch up the slider snaps to the nearest place type;
on tap on a place type label slider moves accordingly. Pull to refresh on the list of places.
